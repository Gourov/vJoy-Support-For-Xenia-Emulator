(SOME GAMES DON'T WORK WITH vJOY in this case after you finish installing vjoy and configuring it, you also need to 
 download x360ce, copy it where the game exe file is located, run it and after it downloads xinput1_3 click clear->auto->save.)

How to use:

First of all:
If you have a gamepad connected to the pc REMOVE IT, 
If you have another virtual gamepad program installed or another version of vjoy (unless it's 2.1.8) UNINSTALL IT.

1.Install Vjoy
2.Open GDSPCK.exe
3.Press "Test" and "VJoy Settings"
4.Configure vjoy and game controller settings to match the screenshot "settings.bmp"
5.Change keybinds in GPDSCK to whatever u like ..
6.Press F4 To run the script (F4 is the default key for "run the script" but u can change it to anything else)
7.When you press F4 the settings window will close, to bring it back either press right-click->settings on the 
	GPDSCK icon next to the clock (system tray), or press ctrl+backspace, or check the "Don't Close Settings Window" checkbox.

	If there are no errors you should hear a Mario Sound and a message will appear on
	the top side of the screen with the text "GPDSCK ON" (the message doesn't appear in full screen, only in
	window or borderless)

If anything goes wrong press CTRL-ALT-DEL (this will close GPDSCK)

TIP:

When you finish rebinding you should click on Test->Properties and press F4 to check if everything's working.

Some INFO:

MouseWheel:
	You can bind the mouse wheel up/down only to the 12 buttons and the DPAD.The mouse wheel will not work as a toggle button. 
	
About RawInputMode:
	It's not 100% ready yet, i don't know if i'll fix it later but it does work well if the mouse has a low polling rate
	under 500 or rly high DPI at ~7000+ so that's why i keept it, also there are some games like DragonBall Xenoverse 2
	that work better with raw input .. 

If you're wondering why i'd use GPDSCK for DBX2 (or Nier Automata):
	It's because on keyboard/mouse some attacks are Broken, attacks like Knockback durring a combo, there's a similar bug
	in nier automata, attack while running "Dash Attack" has a delay, using a gamepad the attack is almost instant. 
	The camera is a bit glitchy so aiming is difficult and there's no dash key for keyboard/mouse users .. 
	With GPDSCK small problems like these can be fixed untill a better solution comes (game patch).

Known Bugs:
	(this should be fixed i'm 99% sure it's not gonna be a problem, but just in case)
	If keyboard/mouse just stop working (u can't even click anything on desktop) after u pressed f4 to stop the script
	press CTRL-ALT-DEL, this will close GPDSCK and open the CTRL-ALT-DEL screen after u cancel or press esc everything 
	should be back to normal.
